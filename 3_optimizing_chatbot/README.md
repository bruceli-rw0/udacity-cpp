# Optimizing Memory Management Chatbot

## Project Introduction Summary
**Purpose:** In this project, you will analyze and modify an existing ChatBot program, which is able to discuss some memory management topics based on the content of a knowledge base. The program can be executed and works as intended. However, no advanced concepts as discussed in this course have been used. There are no smart pointers, no move semantics and not much thought has been given on ownership and on memory allocation.

## Dependencies for Running Locally

* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
